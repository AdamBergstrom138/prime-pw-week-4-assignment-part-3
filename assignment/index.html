    <ul>
      <li>The removeItem(); function was tricky but I think I got it working how it should. </li>
      <li>At first it was deleting everything after the item too, but now it should only be targeting the one item.</li>
      <li>I tried to explain what I was doing more in the comments.</li>
      <li>Is it best practice to return true at the end of a function?  I'm not sure if I'm wording this correct but an example would be the empty(); function.</li>
    </ul>
